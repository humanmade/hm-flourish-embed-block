# Flourish Block

A WordPress block plugin for embedding Flourish data visualizations.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the block:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. For development with automatic rebuilds:
```bash
npm start
```

## Project Structure

- `src/index.js` - Main entry point, registers the block with the editor
- `src/style.scss` - Frontend styles for the block
- `src/editor.scss` - Editor-only styles
- `inc/blocks.php` - PHP block registration and render callback
- `inc/namespace.php` - Plugin namespace and hook setup
- `build/` - Compiled assets (generated by npm build)

## How It Works

- The block is registered as a **dynamic block**, meaning it's rendered server-side by PHP
- The editor shows a placeholder since `save() => null`
- The Flourish embed script is registered and enqueued only once via `wp_register_script()` and `wp_enqueue_script()` to avoid duplicates
- The render callback outputs the Flourish embed HTML with the specified visualization ID
